# NorthernForestWinters

Archive of code and data to quantify indicators of changing winters in the northern forest region of northeastern North America, which are presented in the manuscript, "Northern forest winters have lost cold, snowy conditions that are important for ecosystems and human communities" published in Ecological Applications (doi:##################).

# There are four files of code within this repository:

1. "Northern_Forest_SWE_Modeling" which uses the hydromad.R package (http://hydromad.catchment.org/) to model snow water equivalent (SWE); 
2. "Northern_Forest_Winter_Indicators" which calculates indicators of changing winters relevant to forest ecosystems and people;
3. "Northern_Forest_Trends" which statistically analyzes change over time in northern forest winter indicators; and
4. "Northern_Forest_Figures" which plots the results of trend analyses as presented in the paper.

# There are four data files within this repository that are required to run the above scripts:

1. "daily_station_data.csv" which contains data for daily total precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature, and minumum      temperature within the northern forest study region. Orginal data sources were the United States Global Historical Climatology Network and the National Climate Data Archive of Environment Canada;

2. "metfin.csv" which contains data for daily total precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature, and minumum temperature plus modeled SWE, liquid precipitation (rain), and solid precipitation (snow). Note that "metfin.csv" is generated by running the "Northern_Forest_SWE_Modeling" script with the "daily_station_data.csv" file;

3. "calcfin.csv" which contains annual occurrences of winter climate change indicators for each site in the study region. Note that "calcfin.csv" is generated by running the "Northern_Forest_Winter_Indicators" script along with the "metfin.csv" data file; and

4. "sumtab_all.csv" which contains the statistics Kendall's tau, p, and Sen slope, for evaluating the direction, significance, and magnitude of trends, respectively. Note that "sumtab_all.csv" is generated by running the "Northern_Forest_Trends" script along with "calcfin.csv." 

# Three additional spatial files are required to produce the figures in "Northern_Forest_Figures." These are free and publicly available:
